Assignment: Classwork with HTML5 Part 3 <br>
Description: I am hired by a medical center to develop a website for COVID-19 management. In this classwork, we start building some of the components of this website. Given the COVID-19 risks for patients, I've been assigned the task of designing a simple web aplication that allows users to enter their data and other questions regarding potential symptoms. The web app can then use this self-proclaimed information to determine whether the ptient needs to get tested, treated, or hospitalized (this part will be added later). <br>
